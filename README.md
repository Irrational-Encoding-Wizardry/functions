# kagefunc
kageru's (that's me) Vapoursynth functions\
Functions in separate files are currently in development and will probably not even run.\
Documentation/explanation for each function is given in the docstring.\
A list of dependencies can be found... nowhere, actually. 
I might take the time at some point to create a proper AUR package with all of them. Emphasis on *might*.
  
Message kageru#1337 on discord for questions and suggestions that are not within the scope of a git issue.
  
  
  
##### a random fate reference
I am the encoder of this world.\
Frames are my body, and codecs are my blood.\
I have created over a thousand scripts.\
Unknown to bloat. Nor known to grain.\
Withstood heat to create these videos.\
Yet, those encodes will never be perfect.\
So as I pray, Unlimited Encode Works.
