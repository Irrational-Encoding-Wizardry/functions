# Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry

I am the encoder of this world.
Frameservers are my body, and codecs are my blood.
I have created over a thousand scripts.
Unknown to bloat. Nor known to interlacing.
My CPU withstood pain to create videos.
Yet, those encodes will never be perfect.
So as I pray, Unlimited Encode Works.
